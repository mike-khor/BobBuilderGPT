The general duties of the project inspector in fulfilling project inspection responsibilities are as follows: 1.Continuous inspection requirements.  The project inspector must have actual personal knowledge obtained by personal and continuous inspection of thework of construction in all stages of its progress that therequirements of the approv ed plans and specifications are being executed.    Continuous inspection means complete inspection of every part of the work. Work , such as concrete work or masonry work that can be in spected only as it is placed, shall require the constant presence of the projectinspector. Other types of work that can be completelyinspected after the work is installed may be carried on while the project inspector is  not present. In any case, the project inspector must personally inspect every partof the work. In no case shal l the project inspector have or assume any duties that will prevent him or her fromproviding continuous inspection.    The project inspector may obtain personal knowledge of the work of construction, either on-site or off-site,from the inspections perfor med by special inspectors or approved assistant inspectors and from the reporting ofothers on testing and inspection of materials and work-manship for compliance with the plans, specificationsand applicable standards. The exercise of reasonable diligence to obtain the f acts shall be required. 2.Relations with the architect or engineer.  The project inspector shall work under the general direction of thearchitect or registered en gineer. Any uncertainties in the inspector\u2019s comprehensio n of the plans and specifications shall be reported pr omptly to the architect or registered engineer for his/her interpretation andinstructions. In no case shall the instructions of thearchitect or registered engi neer be construed to cause work to be done that is not in conformity with theapproved plans, specificati ons and documents authorizing changes. 3.Job file. The project inspector shall keep a file of approved plans and specifi cations (including all approved documents authoriz ing changes) on the job at all times. 4.Construction procedure records.  The project inspector shall keep a record of certain construction proce-dures including, but not limited to the following: A. Concrete pouring operations. The records show the time and date of placing concrete and the time and date of removal of forms in each portion of thestructure. B. Welding operations.

E= 0.7 where the building houses only clinical laboratory, pharma-ceutical, dietetic and/or supportservices spaces, or nonpatient carebuilding which is contiguous toand provides egress or structuralsupport to an acute care hospitalbuilding(s).  E= 1.0 where the building houses any other Basic and/or SupplementaryService spaces.     Where a building contains more than oneBasic and/or Supplementary Service space,the largest value of E shall apply.  (b) The Risk-Based Extension is determined by the seismic risk coefficient, P:  i. Where P \u2264 3.0%, the Risk-Based Extension for the building shall notexceed seven years. ii. Where P > 3.0% but P  \u2264 5.0%, the Risk-Based Extension for the buildingshall not exceed five years. iii. Where P > 5.0%, the Risk-Based Extension for the building shall notexceed two years. iv. Regardless of the seismic coefficient, P, the Risk-Based Extension for any build-ing straddling an Active Fault shall notexceed two years. 1.5. Community access to esse ntial hospital services. The potential effect of closure of the hospitalbuilding on community acce ss to  essential hospital services shall be evaluated.

Verify the vertical and lateral systems; d. Check the condition of the building; ande. Identify special cond itions, anomalies and oddities. 6. Review other data available such as assessments of building performance following past earthquakes. 7. Prepare a summary of the data using an OSHPD- approved format. 8. Perform the evaluation using the procedures in Sections 2.2 through 2.5. 9. Prepare a report of th e findings of the evaluation using an OSHPD-approved format. 2.1.2 Data collection.  Building information pertinent to a structure\u2019s seismic performance, including condition, config-uration, detailing, material strengths and foundation type, shall be obtained in accordance with this section, and documented on drawings and/or sket ches that shall be included with the structural calculations. Exception: Materials testing is not required for reclassification by the collapse prob ability assessment option as permitted by Section 1.4.5.1.2, where nonavailability ofmaterials test is identified as a deficiency in accordance with Section 1.8.2.2(b). 2.1.2.1 Building characteristics. Characteristics of the building relevant to its seismic performance shall be obtainedfor use in the building evaluatio n. This shall include current information on the building\u2019s condition, configuration, mate-rial strengths, detailing and foundation type. This data shallbe obtained from: 1. Review of construction documents; 2. Destructive and nondestructive testing and examination of selected building components; and 3. Field observation of exposed conditions to verify that field conditions substantially match the construction documents in accordance with data collection require-ments in the California Existing Building Code Section303A.3.5.3, or equivalent provisions in later editions ofthe CEBC. The characteristics of the buil ding shall be established, including identification of the gravity- and lateral-load-carry-ing systems. The effective late ral-load carrying system may include structural and nonstructu ral elements that will participate in providing lateral resi stance, although these elements may not have intended to provide lateral resistance. The loadpath shall be identified, taking into account the effects of anymodifications, alterations or additions. The owner or the owner\u2019s authorized agent shall submit the following to the office for review and approval: 1. Complete set of construction documents. 2. Field test report(s) in accordance with Section 2.1.2.2.3. Field observation report, which shall verify that field conditions substantially match the construction documents.   2.1.2.1.1 Nonconforming buildings without constructiondocuments. Where the available construction documents do not provide sufficient detail to characterize the structure, the evaluation may be based on field surveys, summarized in as-built drawings. These drawings must depict building dimen-sions, component sizes, reinforcing information (for concreteand masonry elements), connection details, footing informa-tion, and the proximity of neighboring structures. All parts ofthe building that may contribute to the seismic resistance orthat may be affected by the se ismic response of the structure must be identified. The field su rvey shall establish the physical existence of the structural memb ers, and identify critical load bearing members, transfer mech anisms, and connections. The survey shall include information on the structural  elements and connector materials and details. Performing the field surveywill entail removal of fireproof ing or concrete encasement at critical locations to permit direct visual inspection and mea-surement of elements and connections. Nondestructive tech-niques such as radiographic , electromagnetic and other methods may be used to supplement destructive techniques. 1.Steel elements. Steel elements shall be classified by structural member type (e.g., rolled or build-up, mate-rial grade, and general properties). The survey shallnote the presence of degradation or indications of plas-tic deformation, in tegrity of surface coatings, and signs of any past movement. For degraded elements, the lost TABLE 2.1\u2014SOIL PROFILE TYPES AND SITE COEFFICIENTS SOIL  PROFILE  TYPEPROFILE WITHSITE  COEFFICIENT, S S1 Rock of any characteristic, either shalelike or crystalline in nature.

Visual inspection of welds shall be per American Welding Society D1.1, \u201cStructural Welding Code-Steel.\u201d Structural bolts shall be verified to be in proper configura-tion and tightened as requ ired in the AISC Steel Construction Manual. Rivets shall also be verified to bein proper configuration and in full contact, with \u201cham-mer sounding\u201d conducted on random rivets to ensurethey are functional. Nondestructive testing methods,such as dye penetrant and magnetic particle testing,acoustic emission, radiography and ultrasound shall beused when visual inspectio n identifies degradation or when a particular element or connection is critical to seismic resistance and requires further verification. Forbuildings in which archaic cast and wrought irons areemployed, additional investigations to confirm ductilityand impact resistance shall be conducted. 2.Concrete elements.  The configuration and dimensions of primary and secondary structural elements shall beestablished. The configura tion and condition of reinforcing steel shall be assessed, through removal of con-crete cover and direct visual inspection, and through nondestructive inspection using electromagnetic, radiographic and other methods. Critical parameters of thereinforcing system, such as lap splice length, presenceof hooks, development within concrete, degree of cor-rosion and integrity of the construction shall be estab-lished in sufficient detail to perform the structuralevaluation. 3.Masonry elements. The configuration and dimensions of masonry elements shall be  established. The configuration and condition of reinforcing steel shall beassessed, through removal of masonry cover and directvisual inspection, and through nondestructive inspec-tion using electromagnetic, radiographic and othermethods. Critical parameters of the reinforcing system,such as lap splice length, presence of hooks, develop-ment within concrete, degree of corrosion and integrityof the construction shall be established in sufficientdetail to perform the structural evaluation. 4.Wood elements. The configuration and dimensions of wood elements; the connections between wood ele-ments; and the connection s between wood and other FIGURE 2.1a\u2014EFFECTIVE PEAK ACCELERATION COEFFICIENT ( Aa) AND EFFECTIVE PEAK VELOCITY COEFFICIENT ( Av) FOR CALIFORNIA No. County EPA Aa EPV Av No. County EPA Aa EPV Av 1 Alameda 0.40 0.40 30 Orange 0.40 0.40 2 Alpine 0.20 0.20 31 Placer 0.20 0.20 3 Amador 0.20 0.20 32 Plumas 0.20 0.20 4 Butte 0.20 0.20 33 Riverside 0.40 0.40 5 Calaveras 0.20 0.20 34 Sacramento 0.20 0.30 6 Colusa 0.20 0.30 35 San Benito 0.40 0.40 7 Contra Costa 0.40 0.40 36 San Bernardino 0.40 0.40 8 Del Norte 0.20 0.20 37 San Diego 0.40 0.40 9 El Dorado 0.20 0.20 38 San Francisco 0.40 0.40 10 Fresno 0.40 0.40 39 San Joaquin 0.30 0.30 11 Glenn 0.20 0.20 40 San Luis Obispo 0.40 0.40 12 Humboldt 0.20 0.30 41 San Mateo 0.40 0.40 13 Imperial 0.40 0.40 42 Santa Barbara 0.40 0.40 14 Inyo 0.40 0.40 43 Santa Clara 0.40 0.40 15 Kern 0.40 0.40 44 Santa Cruz 0.40 0.40 16 Kings 0.40 0.40 45 Shasta 0.20 0.20 17 Lake 0.30 0.30 46 Sierra 0.20 0.20 18 Lassen 0.20 0.20 47 Siskiyou 0.20 0.20 19 Los Angeles 0.40 0.40 48 Solano 0.40 0.40 20 Madera 0.20 0.30 49 Sonoma 0.40 0.40 21 Marin 0.40 0.40 50 Stanislaus 0.40 0.40 22 Mariposa 0.20 0.20 51 Sutter 0.20 0.20 23 Mendocino 0.40 0.40 52 Tehama 0.20 0.20 24 Merced 0.40 0.40 53 Trinity 0.20 0.30 25 Modoc 0.20 0.20 54 Tulare 0.40 0.40 26 Mono 0.40 0.40 55 Tuolumne 0.20 0.20 27 Monterey 0.40 0.40 56 Ventura 0.40 0.40 28 Napa 0.40 0.40 57 Yolo 0.20 0.30 29 Nevada 0.20 0.20 58 Yuba 0.20 0.20 structural components or elements such as concrete or masonry walls shall be established. The configuration and condition of wood members, including size, type,grade, condition and quality shall be assessed, throughremoval of finish materials,  and examination of unfinished areas such as attics, crawl spaces and basements.Critical connections and el ements shall be visually inspected, using invasive procedures or removal of fin-ishes where necessary. For sh ear walls, select locations shall be exposed to allow evaluation of sheathing mate-rial, nail size, spacing and installation (e.g., overdriven ornails that miss or split the framing members). The baseconnections of shear resisting elements shall beinspected and evaluated for th eir adequacy to connect the base of the structure to the foundation or structure below. 5.Foundation elements. In the absence of dependable construction drawings, determination of the size anddetailing of the foundation system requires invasive pro-cedures. The evaluator shall select representative foot-ings for exposure to establish footing size and depth.Conservative assumptions regarding the reinforcementmay be made considering code requirements and localpractice at the time of the de sign. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it may be assumed that the founda-tion elements were adequate ly designed to resist actual gravity loads to which the building has been subjected. 2.1.2.2 Material properties. The building evaluation shall be based on the strength and deformation properties of the exist-ing materials and components. The strength of existing compo-nents shall be calculated using data on their configuration,obtained from the original construction documents, supple-mented by field observations and the test values of materialproperties. Where such effects ma y have a delete rious effect on component or structural behavior, allowances shall be made forthe likely effects of strain hardening or degradation. Test val-ues may be obtained from samples extracted from the structure,or from original materials an d compliance certificates. The Office will determine the adequacy of the  test results based upon the approved material testing program. The materials testing program shall require approval by the Office prior to testing. Prior to performing destructivematerials test and nondestructive tests requiring modificationto existing conditions, the owner or the owner\u2019s authorizedagent shall obtain a building permit. The materials testing shall be in accordance with the California Existing Building Code Section 303A.3.5.3, or equiva-lent provisions in later editions of the CEBC. 2.1.2.2.1 Nonconforming buildin gs with construction documents. The material properties for nonconforming buildings for which original construction documents of sufficient detail are available shall be confirmed by testing or from acceptable original materials and compli ance certificates. If original materials and compliance certificates are available, they mustprovide the information specified in Items 1 through 4 of thissection to be considered acceptable. 1.Steel elements. The following properties are required for each member type (e.g.,  beams, columns, braces) and each steel grade used in the structure:a) Ultimate tensile and yield capacities; b) Modulus of elasticity; and c) Deformation characteris tics including mode of failure. 2.Concrete elements. The following material properties are required for each memb er type (e.g., beams, columns, walls) in the structure: a) Concrete compressive strength; b) Concrete unit weight; c) Concrete modulus of elasticity;d) Reinforcing steel tensile yield point;e) Reinforcing steel modulus of elasticity; f) Reinforcing steel chemi cal composition and carbon equivalent; and g) Reinforcing steel surface deformations. 3.Masonry elements.  The following material properties are required for each type of masonry in the structure: a) Masonry compressive strength;b) Masonry unit weight; c) Masonry modulus of elasticity;d) Reinforcing steel tensile yield point;e) Reinforcing steel modulus of elasticity; f) Reinforcing steel chemi cal composition and carbon equivalent; and g) Reinforcing steel surface deformations. 4.Wood elements. The following materi al properties are required for each type of w ood element in the structure: a) Identification of Wood Species, andb) Grade Material. (Note: This may be established by visual inspection or stamped labels on the element.) 2.1.2.2.2 Nonconforming buildings without construction documents. The material properties for nonconforming buildings for which original co nstruction documents of sufficient detail are unavailable sha ll be confirmed by testing. The number and location of tests shall be selected so as to provide sufficient information to adequately define the existing condition o f materials in the building. The evaluator shall determine the number and location of tests. The test locations shallbe located throughout the entire building in those componentswhich provide the primary path  of lateral force resistance. 2.2 Selection and use of evaluation statements.  2.2.1 Identification of building type. The evaluator shall determine the building type using the following procedure: 1. Identify the lateral-force-resisting system using text and drawings, including wh atever components are available and effective to constitute a system. Prepare floor and roof plans, and elev ations and sketches of the lateral-force-re sisting system. 2. Select one or more of the 15 common building types which best characterize the structure (see Sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 below). Structures with multiple lateral force resisting systems (different lateral systems in orthogonal directions, or structures wh ere the system changes from level to level) may require the use of two or more building types. In the case of hybrid structures or other build-ings that cannot be adequately classified using the 15building types, the alternativ e analysis procedure shall be used, or the building shall be placed in SPC \u201c1.\u201d 3. Reproduce from the Appendix the list of evaluation statements. These statements shall be used for all types of buildings. Some statements on the list may not beappropriate. These statemen ts may be marked \u201cNA\u201d as \u201cnot applicable.\u201d The Appendi x also contains the set of evaluation statements that address foundations and geo-logic site hazards, and nonstructural elements. 2.2.2 Using the general procedure. The general procedure involving use of the set of evaluation statemen ts presented in the Appendix consists of the following steps: 1. Evaluate the basic buildin g system according to the evaluation statements in Article 3; 2. Evaluate the vertical systems resisting lateral forces according to Article 4 (moment frames), Article 5 (shear walls) or Article 6 (braced frames) as appropriate. For buildings with a combination of vertical systems, each system in the bui lding must be evaluated; 3. Evaluate the diaphragm or horizontal bracing system according to Article 7; 4. Evaluate the structural conne ctions according to Article 8; 5. Evaluate the foundation and possible geologic site hazards according to Article 9; 6. Evaluate the nonstructural elements that involve immediate life-safety issues acco rding to Article 10; and 7. Evaluate the critical nonstructural components and systems according to Article 11. If a statement is found to be  true, the condition being evaluated is acceptable according to th e criteria of these regulations, and the issue may be set as ide. If a statement is found to be false, a condition exists that needs to be addressed further,using the specified analysis pr ocedures. Analysis procedures are given in Section 2.4. Each  statement includes a reference to a particular section in Arti cles 3 through 10 where additional procedures for the reso lution of the issues are given. The evaluator shall assemble the list of deficiencies and theresults of the analysis and pr oceed to the final evaluation in Section 2.5. 2.2.3 Common building types.  The evaluator shall determine the type(s) of building being evaluated, choosing from among the following 15 common types: 1.Building Type 1\u2014Wood, light frame. These buildings are typically small structures of one or more sto-ries. The essential structural  character of this type is repetitive framing by wood joists on wood studs. Loadsare light and spans are smal l. These buildings may have relatively heavy chimneys and may be partially or fullycovered with veneer. Latera l loads are transferred by diaphragms to shear walls. The diaphragms are roofpanels and floors. Shear walls are exterior wallssheathed with plank siding, stucco, plywood, gypsumboard, particle board or fiberboard. Interior partitions are sheathed with plaster or gypsum board. 2.Building Type 2\u2014Wood, commercial and industrial. These are buildings with  a floor area of 5,000 square feet or more and with few, if any, interior bear-ing walls. The essential stru ctural character is framing by beams on columns. The beams may be glulambeams, steel beams or trusse s. Lateral forces usually are resisted by wood dia phragms and exterior walls sheathed with plywood, stucco, plaster or other panel-ing. The walls may have rod bracing. Large exteriorwall openings often require post-and-beam framing.Lateral force resistance on those lines may be achieved with steel rigid fr ames or diagonal bracing. 3.Building Type 3\u2014Steel moment frame. These buildings have a frame of steel columns and beams. Lateralforces are resisted by the development of flexuralforces in the beams and co lumns. In some cases, the beam-column connections have very small momentresisting capacity but, in other cases, the connections of some of the beams and columns were designed to fullydevelop the member capaciti es. Lateral loads are transferred by diaphragms to mome nt resisting frames. The diaphragms can be of almo st any material. The  fra  mes develop their stiffness by full or partial moment con-nections. The frames can be located almost anywherein the building. Usually the columns have their strongdirections oriented so that some columns act primarilyin one direction while the ot hers act in the other direction, and the frames consist of lines of strong columnsand their intervening beams. 4.Building Type 4\u2014St eel braced frame. These buildings are similar to Type 3 buildings except that thevertical components of the lateral-force-resisting sys-tem are braced frames rather than moment frames. 5.Building Type 5\u2014Steel light frame.  These buildings are pre-engineered and pref abricated with transverse rigid frames. The roof and walls consist of lightweightpanels. The frames are built in segments and assem-bled in the field with bolted joints. Lateral loads in thetransverse direction are re sisted by the rigid frames with loads distributed to  them by shear elements. Loads in the longitudina l direction are resisted entirely by shear elements. The shear elements can beeither the roof and wall sheathing panels, an independent system of tension-only rod bracing, or a combi-nation of panels and bracing. 6.Building Type 6\u2014Steel frame with concrete shearwalls. The shear walls in thes e buildings are cast-inplace concrete and may be bearing walls. The steelframe is designed for vertical loads only. Lateral loadsare transferred by diaphragms of almost any material to the shear walls. The steel frame may provide a secondary lateral-force-resisting system depending on thestiffness of the frame and the moment capacity of thebeam-column connections. In \u201cdual\u201d systems, the steelmoment frames are designed to work together with theconcrete shear walls in proportion to their relativerigidities. In this case, the walls would be evaluated under this building type and the frames would be evaluated under Type 3, Steel Moment Frames. 7.Building Type 7\u2014Steel frame with infill shear walls. This is one of the older type of buildings. The infill walls usually are offset from the exterior framemembers, wrap around them, and present a smoothmasonry exterior with no indication of the frame. Sol-idly infilled masonry panels  act as a diagonal compression strut between the intersections of the momentframe. If the walls do not fully engage the frame mem-bers (i.e., lie in the same plane), the diagonal compres-sion struts will not develop. The peak strength of thediagonal strut is determined by the tensile stress capacity of the masonry panel. The post-cracking strength isdetermined by an analysis of a moment frame that ispartially restrained by the cracked infill. The analysis shall be based on published research and shall treat the system as a composite of a frame and the infill. An analysis that attempts to treat the system as a frame andshear wall is not permitted. 8.Building Type 8\u2014Concrete moment frame. These buildings are similar to Type 3 buildings except thatthe frames are of concrete. There is a large variety offrame systems. Older buildings may have framebeams that have broad shal low cross sections or are simply the column strips of flat-slabs. 9.Building Type 9\u2014Concrete shear walls. The vertical components of the lateral -force-resistin g system in these buildings are concrete shear walls that are usuallybearing walls. In older buildings, the walls often arequite extensive and the wall stresses are low but rein-forcing is light. Remodeling that entailed adding orenlarging the openings for windows and doors maycritically alter the strength of the modified walls. Innewer buildings, the shear walls often are limited inextent, generating the need for boundary members andadditional design consideration of overturning forces. 10.Building Type 10\u2014Concrete frame with infill shearwalls. These buildings are similar to Type 7 buildingsexcept that the frame is of  reinforced concrete. The analysis of this building is similar to that recommendedfor Type 7 except that the sh ear strength of the concrete columns, after cracking of the infill, may limit thesemiductile behavior of the system. Research that isspecific to confinement of the infill by reinforced con-crete frames shall be used for the analysis. 11.Building Type 11\u2014Preca st/tilt-up concrete walls with lightweight flexible diaphragm. These build-ings have a wood or metal deck roof diaphragm thatdistributes lateral forces to precast concrete shearwalls. The walls are thin but relatively heavy whilethe roofs are relatively light. Tilt-up buildings oftenhave more than one story. Walls can have numerousopenings for doors and windows of such size that thewall behaves more like a frame than a shear wall. 12.Building Type 12\u2014Precast  concrete frames with concrete shear walls. These buildings contain floor and roof diaphragms typi cally composed of precast concrete elements with or  without cast-in-place con-crete topping slabs. The di aphragms are supported by precast concrete girders a nd columns. The girders often bear on column corb els. Closure strips between precast floor elements and beam-column joints usu-ally are cast-in-place concrete. Welded steel insertsoften are used to interconnect precast elements. Lat-eral loads are resisted by  precast or cast-in-place concrete shear walls. 13.Building Type 13\u2014Reinf orced masonry bearing walls with wood or metal deck diaphragms. These buildings have perimeter bearing walls of reinforcedbrick or concrete-block ma sonry. These walls are the vertical elements in the la teral-force-resisting system. The floors and roofs are fr amed either with wood joists and beams with plywood or straight or diagonalsheathing or with steel beam s with metal deck with or without a concrete fill. Wood floor framing is sup-ported by interior wood posts or steel columns; steel beams are supported by steel columns. 14.Building Type 14\u2014Reinf orced masonry bearing walls with precast concrete diaphragms.  These buildings have bearing walls similar to those of Type 13 buildings, but the roof and floors are composed ofprecast concrete elements such as planks or tee-beams, and the precast roof  and floor elements are supported on interior beams and columns of steel orconcrete (cast-in-place or precast). The precast horizontal elements may have  a cast-in-place topping. 15.Building Type 15\u2014Unrei nforced masonry (URM) bearing wall buildings. These buildings include structural elements that vary depending on the build-ing's age and, to a lesser extent, its geographic loca-tion. In buildings built before 1900, the majority offloor and roof construction consists of wood sheathing supported by wood subframing. In large multi-story buildings, the floors  are cast-in-place concrete supported by the unreinforced masonry walls and/orsteel or concrete interior framing. In buildings builtafter 1950, unreinforced masonry buildings withwood floors usually have plywood rather than boardsheathing. The perimeter walls, and possibly someinterior walls, are unreinf orced masonry. The walls may or may not be anchored to the diaphragms. Tiesbetween the walls and diap hragms are more common for the bearing walls  than for walls that are parallel to the floor framing. Unreinforced masonry bearing wallbuildings (TYPE 15) shall be assigned to SPC 1. Nofurther analysis is required. 2.3 Follow-up field work. The first assessment of the evaluation statements may indicate a need for more information about the building. The evaluator shall make additional sitevisits, performing the necessary surveys and tests to completethe evaluation. 2.4 Analysis of the building. The general requirements for building analysis (including the determination of force level, horizontal distribution of late ral forces, accidental torsion, interstory drift and overturning)  are summarized in this section. For cases where dynamic analysis is required, the gen-eral requirements are given in Section 2.4.10. .4.1 Scope of analysis. When an evaluation statement is false and requires further analysis, the evaluator shall provide appropriate analyses that will  cover the statement requirements. For the analysis , the evaluator will: 1. Calculate the building weights; 2. Calculate the building period; 3. Calculate the lateral force on the building;4. Distribute the lateral force over the height of the building; 5. Calculate the story shear s and overturning moments; 6. Distribute the story shears to  the vertical resisting elements in proportion to their relative stiffness; 7. Examine the individual elem ents as required by the evaluation statements:a. Load and reaction diagrams  for diaphragms and for the vertical resisting elements; b. Shearing stresses and chord forces in the diaphragm; c. Vertical components (wal ls and frames) and find the story deflections, member forces and deflections; and d. Total forces or deflectio ns according to the specified load combinations. For moment frames consisting of beams and columns, the distribution of story shears to the vertical lateral-force-resist-ing elements in that story may be in proportion to their rela-tive stiffness. In multistory fr ame-shear wall structures or in structures where the vertical re sisting elements have significantly different lateral stiffnesses, or where the stiffnesses ofthe vertical resisting elements  change significantly over the height of the structure, an an alysis of the entire structure under the prescribed latera l loads shall be performed. 2.4.2 Demand. All building componen ts evaluated shall resist the effects of the seismi c forces prescribed herein and the effects of gravit y loadings from dead, floor live and snow loads. The following load co mbinations shall be used: Q = 1.1 Q D + QL + QS \u00b1 QE (2-1) or Q = 0.9 QD \u00b1 QE (2-2) where: Q= the effect of the combined loads. QD= the effect of dead load. QE= the effect of seismic forces. QL= the effective live load is equal to 25 percent of the unreduced design live load but not less than the actual live load. QS= the effective snow load is equal to either 70 percent of the full design snow load or, where conditions warrantand are approved by OSHPD,  not less than 20 percent of the full design snow lo ad except that, where the design snow load is less than 30 pounds per squarefoot, no part of the load need be included in seismicloading.The seismic portion of the demand ( Q E) is obtained from analysis of the building using the seismic base shear ( V) from Equation", "title": "ARTICLE 1"}

Therigid base shall have a calculated natural period ineach direction of not more than 0.06 seconds. Theperiods shall be evaluated using Eq. 2-7, or its equiv-alent, considering the total mass of the flexible upperportion concentrated at the top of the rigid base. The flexible upper portion shall be evaluated as a separatestructure supported laterally by the rigid base. Therigid base shall be evaluate d as a separate structure. The reactions of the flexible upper portion shall beapplied at the top of the rigid base, amplified by theratio of the  R and C d factors of the superstructure divided by those for the base structure. The values ofR and C d for the base structure shall be greater than or equal to those used for the superstructure.

For buildings having a period of 2.5 seconds or more, k = 2. For buildings having a period between 0.5 and 2.5 seconds,  k may be taken as 2 or may be determined by linear interpolation between 1 and 2.

At any level, the overturning moments to beresisted shall be estimated using those seismic forces ( F t and Fx) that act on levels above the level under consideration. At any level, the incremental changes of the overturning momentshall be distributed to the various resisting elements in thesame proportion as distribution of the horizontal shears tothose elements.

If approved by the commission, a community sh ared solar system, other community shared renewa ble system, community shared battery storage syst em or combination of the aforementioned system s (hereinafter referred to as a community shared solar or battery storage system) maybe used as a compliance option to partially or totallymeet the on-site solar electric generation system and/orbattery storage system that is otherwise required bySection 140.0(c), 150.1(a)3 or 170.0(a)3 of Title 24, California Code of Regulations, Part 6. To beapproved, the community shared solar electric genera-tion or community shared ba ttery storage system must demonstrate, to the Commissi on\u2019s satisfaction, that all the following requirements will be met: 1.Enforcement agency. The community sharedsolar electric generation system and/or commu-nity shared battery storage system shall beinstalled and available for enforcement agencysite inspection, no later than the point in timethe enforcement agency must physically verifycompliance of the building, which would other-wise be required to have an on-site solar electricgeneration and/or battery storage system, andshall not cause delay in the process of enforce-ment agency review and approval of that build-ing. The enforcement agency shall havejurisdiction and facilitate d access to make site inspections. All documentation for the commu-nity solar electric generation system and/orcommunity solar battery storage system that isrequired to demonstrate compliance for thebuilding shall be completed prior to buildingpermit application. 2.Energy performance.  The community shared solar electric generation system and/or commu-nity shared battery st orage system shall be demonstrated to provide the same or betterenergy performance equal to the partial or totalcompliance with the ener gy performance of the on-site solar electric generation and/or batterystorage system that wo uld otherwise have been required for the building, computed by compli-ance software certified for use by the Commission. 3.Participating building energy savings benefits.The community shared so lar electric generation system and/or community shared battery storagesystem shall provide energy saving benefitsdirectly to the building. The energy savings bene-fits allocated to the building shall be in the formof: A. actual reductions in the energy consumption of the participating  building; B. energy reduction cred its that will result in virtual reductions in the building\u2019s energyconsumption that is subject to energy billpayments; or  C. payments to the building that will have an equivalent effect as energy bill reductions.    The reduction in the building\u2019s energy billresulting from A, B or C above shall be greaterthan the added cost to the building resultingfrom the building\u2019s share in the communityshared solar and/or battery storage system.  4.Durability, Participation and building opt-out.  A.Durability.  The community shared solar electric generation system and/or commu-nity shared battery st orage system shall be designed and installed to provide theenergy savings benefits to the participatingbuilding(s) specified in Section 10-115(a)3for a period of no less than 20 years.  B.Participation. The Administrator(s) approved by the Energy Commission pursu-ant to Section 10-115(b)1  shall ensure that all participating buildings, which use the com-munity shared solar and/or communityshared battery storage system to comply withSection 140.0(c), 150.1(a)3 or 170.0(a)3,remain participating buildings for no lessthan a 20-year period (\u201cParticipationPeriod\u201d), regardless of who owns or occupiesthe participating building, unless the buildingowner discontinues participation after caus-ing the on-site solar electric generation sys-tem to be installed and interconnectedpursuant to the Opt-Out Requirements. Forpurposes of this Section, \u201cOpt-Out Require-ments\u201d shall mean installation and intercon-nection of an on-site solar electric generationsystem that meets or  exceeds the requirements of Section 140.0(c), 150.1(a)3 or > >> .0(a)3 in effect at the time the builder applied for the original building permit for the participating building. To demonstratecompliance, the Administrator shall requireeither of the following:   i.Equitable servitude. As a condition for a building to participate, participating builders shall impose an equitable servi-tude through a properly recorded declara-tion of covenants, conditions andrestrictions (\u201cCC&Rs\u201d) or other properlyrecorded covenant, deed restriction orother legally binding method referencedin each deed transfe rring title for each participating building. This equitable servitude shall run with the land and obligate the original owner(s)/tenant(s) andall subsequent owner(s)/tenant(s) of theparticipating building to maintain thebuilding\u2019s participation in the communityshared solar and/or community sharedbattery storage system for the Participa-tion Period, or ensure installation andinterconnection of an on-site solar elec-tric generation system that satisfies theOpt-Out Requirements. The equitableservitude shall specify that in order todiscontinue participation in the commu-nity shared solar and/or battery system,the building owner must satisfy the Opt-Out Requirements. The builder shallensure that the equitable servitude pro-vides the Administrator approved by theCommission the right to enforce theabove provisions. The equitable servi-tude shall remain in force for a period of 20 years from the date of first participa-tion of the building in the communityshared solar and/or battery system. Theequitable servitude shall not be revoca-ble. The equitable servitude shall bedelivered to all responsible partiesthrough transfer disclosure statements.  ii.Other system . The Commission may approve another program, structure orsystem by which an Administrator (orother entity approved by the Commis-sion) ensures the requirements of thisSection 10-115(a)4B will be satisfied fora Participation Period of no less than 20years.  C.Compliance docu mentation. The Administrator shall maintain record(s) of the com-pliance documentation that determined therequirements for the on-site solar electricgeneration system and/or battery storagesystem to comply with the standards ineffect at the time the builder applied for the original building permit, and which estab-lishes participants\u2019 obligations to meet the Opt-Out Requirements. The Administrator shall provide a copy of this compliance documentation upon a participating build-ing owner\u2019s request, to every new owner ofa participating building when the Adminis-trator is notified that title has transferred,and to any participating building ownerwho requests to Opt-Out.  D.Building opt-out. At any time during the Participation Period, a participating build-ing owner shall have the option to discon-tinue the participation of the building in thecommunity shared solar and/or battery stor-age system (\u201cOpt-Out\u201d) if the building sat-isfies the Opt-Out Requirements.   i. Prior to Opt-Out, the building owner shall demonstrate that they have installed such an on-site sola r electric generation system and met the Opt-Out Require-ments by providing documentation fromthe installer of the on-site solar system oran attestation of the building owner withsupporting documentation.  The building owner shall be responsible for all costs associated with documentingthat the on-site solar generation systemsatisfies the Opt-Out Requirements.  ii. Upon receiving documentation regarding Opt-Out from a building owner, theAdministrator shall compare the docu-mentation to the compliance documenta-tion specified in Section 10-115(a)4Cand confirm whether, based on the docu-mentation, the installed solar systemmeets or exceeds the Opt-Out Require-ments. Within 30 days of a buildingowner providing documentation, theAdministrator shall provide written con-firmation to the building owner whether,based on the Administrator\u2019s review ofthat documentation, the on-site solar gen-eration system satisfies the Opt-OutRequirements. The Administrator may, atits discretion, verify the documentationthrough a physical inspection. TheAdministrator shall maintain record ofthe documentation that demonstrates andconfirms the on-site solar generation sys-tem met the Opt-Out requirements for theremainder of the Participation Period.  iii. Upon a building owner\u2019s exercise of the Opt-Out, all costs and benefits associatedwith participation in the communityshared solar and/or battery storage sys-tem shall cease. If any balance of costs orbenefits is owed to either party at thetime of Opt-Out, such balance shall bepaid to that party.  iv. The Administrator [or other entity approved by the Commission pursuant to Section 10-115(a)4Bii] shall not imposeany penalty related to a participatingbuilding\u2019s Opt-Out, or charge partici-pants for recuperation of unrealized revenue that would have been expected toaccrue beyond the end of participation. Ifthe Administrator (or other entityapproved by the Commission) plans tocharge any other fees at the time of build-ing Opt-Out, the Application for Com-mission Approval shall explain thepurpose of those fees.  5.Additionality.  The community shared solar electric generation system and/or community sharedbattery storage system shall provide the energy savings benefits specified in Section 10-115(a)3exclusively to the participating building(s).Those energy savings benefits shall in no way beattributed to other purposes or transferred to otherbuildings or property.  A. The participating building(s) shall be served primarily by renewable resourcesdeveloped specifically for the communitysolar electric generation system.  B. Other renewable resources may be used when participating buildings are permittedbefore the renewable resources developedfor the program start op erating or after they cease operating. During these times, otherrenewable resources may be used to meetthe requirements of Section 10-115(a)4 foreach participating building.  C. The renewable resources, including those developed primarily to serve participatingbuildings and those utilized to serve partic-ipating buildings during the time periodsdescribed in Section 10-115(a)5B for thepurpose of meeting the requirements ofSection 10-115(a)4, sh all meet the following requirement:   i. For each renewable resource used to serve participating buildings, bundled Renewable Energy Credits (RECs),which satisfy the criteria of PortfolioContent Category 1, shall be retired andtracked in the Western RenewableEnergy Generation Information System(WREGIS) on the behalf of program par-ticipants, to ensure that they will not beallocated to or used for any other pur-pose, including Renewable PerformanceStandard (RPS) compliance, resale ofRECs or renewable generation to anyother person or entity, or any other man-datory or voluntary renewable electricityprogram requirement or claim. D. Renewable resources developed to serve participating buildings may also be used toserve other loads when there is excess gen-eration beyond what is needed to serve participating buildings. Any excess generationused for such other lo ads shall be isolated from the generation serving participatingbuildings, and shall not result in violationof Section 10-115(a)5C.  6.Location. The community shared solar electric generation system and/or community shared bat-tery storage system shall be located on a distribution system of the load serving entity providingservice to the participating buildings.  7.Size. The community shared solar electric generation system and/or co mmunity shared battery storage system shall not be served by any individ-ual source larger than 20 MW.  8.Accountability an d recordkeeping.  Applicants for Commission approval of community sharedsolar electric generation systems and/or commu-nity shared battery storage systems shall beaccountable to all parties who relied on these systems for partial or total compliance with the on-site solar electric generation and/or battery stor-age system that would otherwise be required,including but not limited to builders of the build-ings, owners of the buildings, enforcement agen-cies and the Commission.
